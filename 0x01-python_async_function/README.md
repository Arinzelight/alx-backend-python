# 0x01. Python - Async

This project covers fundamental concepts of asynchronous programming in Python, focusing on the `asyncio` library. 
## Learning Objectives

This project covers the following concepts:

- **Async and Await Syntax:** Understanding the `async` and `await` keywords for defining asynchronous functions and coroutines.
  
- **Executing Async Programs with asyncio:** Learning how to run asynchronous programs using the `asyncio.run()` function.
  
- **Running Concurrent Coroutines:** Exploring how to execute multiple coroutines concurrently to improve performance.
  
- **Creating asyncio Tasks:** Understanding how to create and manage tasks using `asyncio.create_task()`.
  
- **Using the Random Module:** Leveraging the `random` module to generate random values asynchronously in your programs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `asyncio` library
